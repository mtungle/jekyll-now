## Summary:
The trading idea presented in this document could make a profit of 74% capital gain over the period from Jan 2017 to Feb 2018 for trading XBT CFD contract in BitMEX exchange. I have written a program to automate my trading strategy. The program went live on 05 Jun 2018. I also wrote another program to backtest my strategy.
Section 1 shows my real trading results from 05 Jun 2018. Section 2 presents the backtesting results. Section 3 outlines the trading idea. Section 4 talks about how I build my trading program. Section 5 is about the simulation used for backtesting. Section 6 shows how I optimize the strategy parameters by Monte Carlo method.
Note: The trading strategy is an adaptation of market making strategy which means we always place buy limit orders and sell limit orders. It also does not have a clear exit point, whether the position size increases and decreases will depend on the price movement. So for the results in section 1 and section 2, we will draw PnL along with the position size (positive means long position and negative means short position). And the position size can be managed to stay round zero.
